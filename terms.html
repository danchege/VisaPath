    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to VisaPath. By using our website and services, you agree to the following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully before applying for or offering any job through our platform.</p>

    <h2>2. Job Placement Process</h2>
    <p>VisaPath connects job seekers with employers across the globe. We facilitate the application, screening, and placement process, but final hiring decisions are made by the employers.</p>

    <h2>3. Rates and Fees</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>VisaPath charges a service fee equal to <strong>10% of the gross salary for the first 12 months</strong> of employment for each successful placement.</li>
      <li>This fee is deducted directly from the employee's monthly salary and remitted to VisaPath by the employer.</li>
      <li>There are no upfront fees for job seekers to apply for jobs through VisaPath.</li>
      <li>Additional administrative or processing fees may apply for certain services (e.g., visa processing, document verification). These will be clearly communicated in advance.</li>
      <li><strong>Visa and Passport Assistance:</strong> If you are unable to pay the full cost of your visa or passport application upfront, VisaPath can assist by covering the remaining amount as a loan. You simply pay what you can, and VisaPath pays the rest. The total amount (plus a commission of 10%) will be deducted from your first salary as repayment for the loaned amount.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Candidate Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide accurate and truthful information during the application process.</li>
      <li>Comply with all legal and immigration requirements of the destination country.</li>
      <li>Maintain professional conduct throughout the recruitment and employment period.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Employer Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide clear job descriptions, requirements, and compensation details.</li>
      <li>Remit VisaPath's service fee as agreed.</li>
      <li>Ensure fair and legal treatment of all employees.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Payment Terms</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>VisaPath's service fee (10% of the first 12 months' gross salary) is deducted monthly and paid by the employer.</li>
      <li>Failure to remit fees may result in suspension of services or legal action.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>VisaPath acts as an intermediary and is not responsible for the actions of employers or employees. We do not guarantee job offers, visa approvals, or employment outcomes. Our liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>

    <h2>8. Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We respect your privacy. Personal data is collected and processed in accordance with our <a href="#">Privacy Policy</a>. We do not sell your data to third parties.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Information</h2>
